Different [rulesets](https://qon.github.io/mixed-cellular-automatons/ca.html#{%22colors%22:%5B{%22t%22:-1,%22c%22:%5B255,255,255%5D},{%22t%22:15,%22c%22:%5B255,0,255%5D},{%22t%22:30,%22c%22:%5B0,0,255%5D},{%22t%22:45,%22c%22:%5B0,255,255%5D},{%22t%22:60,%22c%22:%5B0,255,0%5D},{%22t%22:100,%22c%22:%5B255,255,0%5D},{%22t%22:480,%22c%22:%5B255,0,0%5D},{%22t%22:null,%22c%22:%5B0,0,0%5D}%5D,"toprule":110,"bottomrule":110,%22cellsize%22:4})
 are also possible, like rule 110 at bottom and top!

Edit cellsize in url to larger values for larger cells and better performance.
